You can see the formal description of the maintainers role at http://www.astropy.org/team.html. If you have any uncertainty or if there is extended debate about merging a PR, seek consensus from other maintainers in the Project, or if absolutely necessary, the Coordination Committee.

If you would like to accept this nomination, we ask that you familiarize yourself with the following Project guidelines:

* [Astropy Project Code of Conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html)

If you accept, please respond indicating that you've reviewed (or plan to review) the developer documentation and that you have read and agree to abide by the Code of Conduct. After we receive that email from you, we will make an announcement and there will be a two week period of comment. After that period is over, your name will be added to the team webpage and you will be given the appropriate Github permissions.

Congratulations on the nomination and thanks for your contributions! We very much hope you accept it. We're very happy to answer any questions you may have about the role.
